This was a side project I made in my spare time. It was my attempt at an endless space shooter game originally designed for a vertical screen
Controls:
  The ship follows the mouse
  click or press space to fire
  press e to shoot a super bullet
  if your mouse falls below the dashed line, time speeds up
  
Don't let the blocks pass the dashed line
highest score wins
